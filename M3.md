<h3>Section 2.B Element Interfaces</h3>

According to SEI, an interface is a boundary across which two independent entities meet and interact or communicate with each other. The type of interface depends on the view type of its element. Since in our case we have different modules listed within components, the interface is the definition of services. An element can occur in more than one view, aspects of its interface can be different depending on the nature of view. Typically an interface to a module in a uses view/diagram will describe the method provided by that module to interact with other modules. Let us discuss Curl and Header module for their interfaces.

Interface diagram with notations for showing the existence of Interfaces from SEI guidelines.

![interface_diagram](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/master/InterfaceDiagram.png "Interface Diagram")

**Curl**

The curl method from the primary presentation above, implements two interface methods that help him interact with other modules. An Interface is not only about what is provided by the element, an interface also includes what is required by the element.

1. curlify(request) - Curlify is a part of core component that is called to fetch data from the external API with specific request parameters.

2. request: PropTypes.object - In order to send curlify request the curl module interacts with PropTypes(request specific arguments) to build the request parameters

**Header**

This method is used by response method when it constructs the entire page response. Header method returns markup for HTML head tag and provides interface using two methods.

1. render() - When render function within header module is called, it looks for arguments supplied by property module and further manipulates the HTML markup. It also prints selective property values on the rendered webpage.

2. headers: PropTypes.object - It is just another version of the method that we had in curl module to request PropTypes(request specific arguments) to render header elements.

#### SEI Element Interface Specification

___

**Interface identity**

The modules we selected for interface documentation contains a common interface implementation. The use of method "PropTypes.object" helps to fetch property specific arguments from the property module. In order to differentiate them, we change the container variable to store these properties. In case of curl it is request and with header module it is header.

**Resources provided**

In this section, we will define interfaces with syntax and their usage. Usage includes restriction and semantics.

1. Resource syntax - Syntax for Curl(request: PropTypes.object.isRequired, let curl = curlify(request)). Syntax for Header(headers: PropTypes.object.isRequired, render()).

2. Resource semantics - The 'PropTypes' assigns an array of values to the container variable and can be further used by array index. Changing the markup in render can result in incomplete HTML header, also you can add SEO(search engine optimization) specific meta tags here.

3. Resource-usage restrictions - The render function must return some HTML added inside the function definition. The curlify library must be included before the call to the function. Also, using PropTypes requires an addition of import statement with reference to property module.

**Locally defined data types**

The interfaces discussed in the above cases require a container from the calling method to store the results. The method calling the interface method must declare a variable like curl is used to store the results returned by 'curlify(request)'

**Error-handling**

In the methods above, curl request is prone to errors if the API call done with request parameters is not correct. If you find null value in curl variable the first thing to check is curlify request parameters.

**Variability provided**

The interfaces selected in these methods are provided by external methods like property and curlify and thus cannot be changed.

**Quality attribute characteristics**

This part of the specification will discuss quality attribute, the interface makes known to the method's user.

1. Performance - The efficiency of curl() request is directly proportional to the react render time.

2. Accessibility - Presence and absence of specific markup for the header tag in the render() function will result in low compatibility score. 

3. Maintainability - The Prop.Types.object() supplies the property arguments in a combined format without specific request types. And thus further developments the module needs some change to handle abstract arguments.

**What the element requires**

This is section talks about the resources provided by other elements in the system to the interfaces. We have already discussed these in details above.

**Rationale and design issues**

Please refer to Section 4.

**Usage Guide**

The details related to this section are already covered in resources provided.

<h3>Section 2.C Element Behaviour</h3>

Behaviour diagrams are used to visualize and document the dynamic aspects of the system under consideration. We have presented a procedural sequence diagram to specify and construct react rendering mechanism in Swagger-UI. Sequence diagrams depict ordering of messages/function calls according to time. The objects that initiate the interaction are placed on the x-axis and the messages/functionality they send and receive are placed on the y-axis.

This diagram elaborates sequence of steps followed by React component to load the system when a user(Actor) interacts with the Swagger-UI in a web browser. Object description is given on top of each element in the diagram.

<h2>Section 3. Context Diagram</h2>

Shown below is a context diagram for Swagger-UI. It shows how Swagger-UI interacts with external tools and frameworks. The labeled boxes represent the entities(actor), the one in the center is system, and around it multiple boxes for external actor.

**Swagger Core**

Swagger-UI converts files with swagger API specifications into RESTful service documentation. Specification files are in *.json or *.yaml format, these files are converted from *.java (Resource classes with swagger annotations) with the help of swagger core generator.

**OAuth2**

Authorization to access RESTful service documentation on the Swagger-UI frontend is controlled by OAuth2. It enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to a web service.

**Swagger Editor**

A dedicated editor to design, describe and document swagger-based API's.

**Module Bundler (webpack)**

Bundling of assets like javascript files and images for rendering in a web browser. Webpack works on modules and their dependencies to generate static assets representing those modules.

**Compilation(bable)**

Bable is a compilation tool for javascript, it can convert edge JavaScript into plain old JavaScript that can run on any browser.

**Test Execution(enzyme/karma)**

Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility for React. It helps in with writing, maintaining and understanding of tests. Karma is majorly a test-runner that gives a productive testing environment to developers.

**Web Browser**

Swagger-UI generates responsive and interactive .html files with RESTful service documentation. These files are then rendered using web browsers.

<h2>Section 4. Rationale</h2>

The purpose of this module view is to provide a view to aid in the analysis of the selected quality attribute scenario. The quality attribute that this view helps to analyze is performance. One of the quality attribute scenarios that were derived in M2 relates to the UI re-render cycles. A successful response measure of the QAS would show that the number of times Actions (ReactJS) are fired was minimized and that the Swagger-UI is re-rendered in under 150ms on every load. A Uses view was selected to aid in analyzing this scenario as it allows for the UI components to be mapped statically. It also shows which components use other components to aid in rendering each specific component. 

A key feature of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) is that it is component based. Each component holds and manages its own state. They implement a method called *render()* that takes input and then sends it to be rendered to the display. Since components manage their own states this can be useful in displaying data that can be changing at different points in time. It is beneficial to not have components re-render themselves if their state has not changed in relation to other component states.

The reason that the uses view is useful in relation to the React components is that it shows the hierarchy of components. Ideally, only the leaf-most node of a component hierarchy is re-rendered when the state is changed in relation to what is changing. By seeing how the components are mapped, developers and architects can pinpoint where certain re-render actions should be fired.

As shown in the Uses view, the Core of Swagger-UI is split into two distinct parts, Core/Plugins and Core/Components. The components strictly deal with renderings that are put to the display. It can also be seen that there is presence of components in the Plugins. This is due to that these are also React based components. As described in section 2.A, plugins are external code libraries that Swagger-UI uses to aid in rendering OAS specifications to the display. As some of these entities are required to to be rendered, it is logical that they are written as React components. 

Looking closer at Core/Components, the main rendering root shown is Responses. From there it branches into multiple components, including Response. Response is a key branching point, with eight branching components stemming from it. Based on the element descriptions in section 2.A, the component break down is logical. Responses are rendered as an individual Response. Each Response has various components it is required to render. After an initial load of the UI, and after subsequent live changes that occur due to user input the states of these components may or may not change. This hierarchy of components is essentially to ensuring that minimal amounts of the UI is re-rendered on each render cycle.
