<h2>Section 1. Introduction</h2>

When writing code for software, the developers can either opt for a quick and dirty way to get things done quicker or spend the time to add value and do things the "right way". Thinking from the business perspective, until the required feature is working it doesn't matter whats going on under the hood. Our role here is to act as a detective over the written software code and present a report on things that are not done in the "right way". We have divided the report into code quality inspection and technical debt each which is explained in the following sections.

<h2>Section 2. Code Quality Report</h2>

In Software Development, programmers write applications to provide solutions to various everyday problems, and depending on the time allotment and the complexity of the given task, the coders may sacrifice organization and structure to achieve the goals However, as the application grows and matures, the importance of following good coding practices, coordinating with fellow developers and maintaining reliable program structure becomes ever so prominent. This is where Code Quality Assessment becomes an indispensable tool - it helps developers and project managers evaluate the current state of the program code and derive problematic areas, devise strategies to avoid erroneous behaviour and forecast how adaptable the code is to future expansions. <br>

In this report, our team will analyze the code quality of Swagger-UI and report on potential weaknesses and inconsistencies in the code base that might have lasting negative effects on the application in the future. We will use an array of different known code quality assessment tools (such as SonarCloud, CodeScene, Mocha, etc.) to provide maximum coverage and reliability.

<h4>1) The Code Review Process</h4>
<br>

The review process involves both manual and automated review of the source code. These code inspection tools try to dig into finding the possible weakness in the code but it is not guaranteed to find every possible weakness. Following is the list of industry standard tools with links to their report on Swagger-UI code base.

<h4>2) Review Summary</h4>
<br>

Overall, apart from some questionable coding practices and bugs, the Swagger-Ui passed all the assessment and testing benchmarks, which constitutes for a rather healthy coding environment. Nevertheless, any project of a medium to big scope is susceptible to technical debts and fatal shortcuts that were overlooked or forgotten at some point during the production cycle. The next chapter will cover some of these technical debts, showcasing the areas where the Swagger-Ui could make some improvements to increase maintainability and reliability of the code.

<h4>3) Finding Summary</h4>
<br>
* <h5>Code Smells</h5>

<br>
Here is the result produced by SonarCloud.  

![m5_part1_image1](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image1.png)

Based on the output of the code quality assessment tool, there are 47 code smells divided into three levels: 23 minor, 23 major and 1 critical. The minor code smells mostly comprise of renaming the file and removing unused import statements and variables. The tool suggests to rename the file because the fileâ€™s name is different to the export function/class name. However, by convention, a file that exports only one class, function, or constant should be named after that class, function or constant. Anything else may confuse the maintainers of the code. Here is an example.  

![m5_part1_image2](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image2.png)

The major code smells are more related to the functionality of the code. For example, the tool will raise a concern if an expression always evaluates to true/false, or there are useless assignment, or even if the line is not executed conditionally. Here is an example of useless assignment to local variable.  

![m5_part1_image3](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image3.png)

A dead store happens when a local variable is assigned to a value that is not read by any subsequent instruction, which subsequently leads to a waste of resources. All calculated values should be used.  

The only critical code smell is shown below.  

![m5_part1_image4](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image4.png)

In the absence of enclosing curly braces, the line immediately after a conditional statement is the one that is conditionally executed. Such lines are indented. If both curly braces and indentation are missing, the original intent of the programmer becomes entirely unclear and the execution might produce unpredicted results. Additionally, such code is highly likely to be confusing to maintainers.<br>

For duplications, here is the result shown by the tools.  

![m5_part1_image5](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image5.png)

And here is the overview shown by the tools.  

![m5_part1_image6](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image6.png)

As we can see, the largest offender is pet.js which contains 182 lines of code and 139 duplicated lines. The second one is called user.js which contain only 85 lines of code but 93 duplicated lines. Pet.js is mainly duplicated with store.js, user.js and itself. User.js is mainly duplicated with itself and pet.js.

* <h5>Coding Practices

<br>
When it comes to writing consistently-styled code, the Swagger-Ui team decided to implement linting tools with customized rules based on the existing Babel-ESLint core ruleset. The concrete settings are provided below.  

![m5_part1_image7](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image7.png)

According to the generated reports, for the most part, the code meets the designated standards. However one could debate the legibility and practicality of some of the predefined rules. For example, the absence of semicolons as statement separators is generally considered a bad practice in JavaScript environment for multiple reasons. Firstly, JavaScript provides automatic semicolon insertion, which might be viewed as a convenient feature at first, but due to its convoluted ruleset, it makes it easier for programmers to [produce unintentional bugs which might be hard to identify.](http://es5.github.io/#x7.9) Secondly, some utilities, especially the ones that deal with code compression, might misinterpret the lack of semicolons as one continuous statement, which leads to usability issues and wrongly generated reports. Lastly, the ECMAScript specifications dictate that semicolons are necessary and are an integral part of the language, [which means that their absence might cause compatibility issues in the future.](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion) All this is important to consider when one is preoccupied with keeping high maintainability of their software.<br>

Additionally, in some instances the developer team decided to circumvent the imposed rules because of either technical limitations or mere convenience, which not only generated a few major code smells but also can be viewed as highly counterproductive. The example below shows an instance of code compliance avoidance.  

![m5_part1_image8](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image8.png)

* <h5>Bugs and Vulnerabilities

<br>
The result given by the code quality assessment tool is shown below.  

![m5_part1_image9](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image9.png)

Based on the result given by the code quality assessment tool, there are 15 code smells divided into two levels, 14 major and 1 critical. Major bugs mainly relate to condition change, adding tags, renaming duplicates and removing code. Here is an example of a bug which suggests to remove code.  

![m5_part1_image10](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image10.png)

Return statements move control flow out of the current code block. Typically, any statements in a block that come after return are simply wasted keystrokes.<br>

The only critical bug are shown below.  

![m5_part1_image11](https://github.com/SENG480-18/project-team6/blob/m5_part1/m5_resources/m5_part1_image11.png)

It is easy to call a JavaScript function with more arguments than the function needs, but the extra arguments will be just ignored by function execution.<br>

Based on the result shown by the tools, currently there are no vulnerabilities for Swagger-Ui.

* <h5>Testing and Coverage

<br>

Swagger-Ui provides unit-testing implemented in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Unit testing is usually encouraged in big software development environments (especially the Test Driven Development environments) and helps developers not only assure correct functionality of the program, but also easier implement documentations.<br>

The tests are written according to Mocha standards and reliably represent the desired outcome. According to the [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) coverage tool, the code covers most of the of the application code safe for some lines (see the coverage link above for details). Upon execution, all tests pass successfully.However there is an alarming amount of warnings produced by Mocha testing environment that were left ignored. This might not affect the operability of the current version of the software, but code smells like this may always have an unpredictable impact in the future, which makes the software harder to manage and introduces risks for potential exploits.<br>

The full output of the tests can be found [here]().

<h4>4) Finding Details</h4>
<br>

The details regarding our findings have been categorized as per the following metric:-

* High - Serious impact to the application security, generally unmitigated, large-scale issues, such as an attack that is currently exploitable from the Internet.

* Medium - Notable impact to the application security, or somewhat mitigated high risks (e.g., being available only to the user's Intranet).

* Low - Potential impact to the application security, or heavily mitigated high risk (e.g., being in dead code or after an abort call).

* Informational â€“ Does not directly make the code less secure, but bad coding practice.

<h2>Section 3. Technical Debt Report</h2>

Technical debt is a common occurence in software systems, and Swagger-UI is not exempt from this. The occurence and production of technical debt can be for multiple reasons. Often it is the result of shortcuts in development due to not enough time to develop or design the correct solution. By identifying technical debt in software systems, development teams can identify where refactoring efforts can start. This helps to ensure a well maintained, and effeciently performing system.

The following table is an overview of the potential sources of technical debt in the Swagger-UI system.

| Identified Potential Debt | Description                   | Source(s) |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| React Selectors   | Current implementation of ReactJS selectors in the plugin system do not allow for overriding of low-level selectors. This could lead to consequences in handling how other selectors rely on the overridden selector.  | [Code](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/14ef0cc3796e60f446fffb82343c20aecfadddca/src/core/components/operations.jsx#L126) / [Pull Request](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/pull/4004) |
| Boolean Flag      | A boolean flag set to *false* occurs at the beginning of the source file to prevent multiple executions. At the end of the first execution of the code it is set to *true*. This intoduces a bug where the page may stop scrolling if not refreshed after a period of time. | [Code](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/14ef0cc3796e60f446fffb82343c20aecfadddca/src/core/plugins/deep-linking/spec-wrap-actions.js#L4) / [Issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3958) |
| Plugins vs Presets | Plugins should be loaded in as a base plugin which loads the rest. Instead, a preset variable is loading instead. This relates more to code readability and clarity over long term technical debt. | [Code](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/14ef0cc3796e60f446fffb82343c20aecfadddca/src/core/index.js#L63)|
| Not using React State | Instead of using React state correctly, forceUpdate is being used to "cheat" in this component. While performance is similar, this is considered not the best practice when using React. | [Code](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/14ef0cc3796e60f446fffb82343c20aecfadddca/src/core/plugins/oas3/components/operation-servers.jsx#L32) / [Pull Request](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/pull/3972) |
| Excessive Parsing | Swagger uses data as immutable and as javascript objects, depending on the context. This forces the use of parsing functions in several occasions. Ideally only one type should be used. | [Code](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/1f9fb0e68d6e182544a5dff8a8bcab49a493ac20/src/core/components/response.jsx#L111)

The technical debts *Plugins vs Presets* and *Not using React State* relate to more to not using best practices, versus long term technical debts. While they are not the recommended way of achieving the functionality that they accomplish, they don't hamper a developers ability to continue to develop Swagger-UI. As well, they do not have any long lasting performance issues in the running of Swagger-UI, as they accomplish the same goals as the "best" practice with similar performance. For the technical debt *Excessive Parsing*, this is the result of not sticking to a single type of object consistenly throughout the code. Because of this, there is compounding of parsing to and from these data types. Over time if this is not standardized, there will continue to be compounding parsing throughout the code. This may lead to readability issues and potentially performance issues if there is ever a large object that is required to be parsed.

Another common theme that all most of these technical debts share is their relation to React. It was identified in the Module View and Component and Connector View of this document package that React is an integral part to the rendering of Swagger-UI. While there is no one right way to do things in React, as described in the *React Selectors* section below, sometimes there can be long term affects of not using React correctly.

Below are two of the technical debts identified above, with an in-depth analysis of how these debts may effect the long term development and performance of Swagger-UI.

<b>React Selectors</b>

When listing the possible operations for a scheme in Swagger, it is necessary to limit the operations based on the given API specs and the default specs.
The concept of selector filters for the spec is already present in the code, but there's no structure to choose which selectors can be overridden, given that some selectors depend on others. 

To select which operations are to be rendered in `operations.jsx` a shortcut was taken.
Instead of changing some of the structure of the project to allow a generic way to override selectors, the methods inside the "operations.jsx" file are filtered using a local rule.
This fixed Swagger issue/functionality at the time but creates a certain tech debt.
Although for now only this specific part of the code requires overriding the selectors, it is probable this may become a necessity for other components as well.
When this functionality is required for other files, developers of the project may address the tech debt or continue to increase it, since is more expensive to pay the tech debt than to fix a single issue.
Eventually this could lead to a situation where the filtering functionality is spread out throughout the code, making it the overall code more difficult to maintain.
Therefor this shortcut may end up creating duplication (local filtering in other files) as well as time lost that could have been spent adjusting the structure to allow this functionality.

<b>Boolean Flag</b>

The existence of this boolean flag in src/core/plugins/deep-linking/spec-wrap-actions points to multiple issues in Swagger-UI, and its future development. The reason for the flag *hasHashBeenParsed* is to ensure that the code is only ran once. This means that it is being called multiple times when the specification needs to be resolved. However, since the layout state does not dynamically handle changes to the spec when it is resolved, the code must be forced to only run once. The result of adding this boolean also caused another bug to arise. After a period of time if the page is not refreshed, the scrolling functionality on the page will stop functioning. Typically, this shortcut is the result of a "sweep under the rug". No time has been alotted to fix the layout to handle dynamic resolving of OAS specifications. During the runtime analysis of this technical debt, unfortunately the scrolling bug was unable to be reproduced. Runtime analysis without the flag was also performed, however again no noticable effects were observed. One caveat to note is that this is apart of the deep-linking functionality of Swagger-UI, which is turned off by default in initial installations of Swagger-UI. Deep-linking updates the URL based on what operation you are performing in the UI. If you expand an API funcation in the UI, it will add it to the URL and when you close it, it will remove it. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/deep-linking.md). 

A potential long term affect of the choice is that similar bugs like this may occur in the future. Any new functionality relating to dynamically changing the layout of the UI will not be possible as the layout is only updated once at initialization. The fact that this flag exists may result in new addional features relating to deep-linking not running properly as well. This affects the maintainablity of Swagger-UI, a key quality attribute identified in M2. This technical debt will require two things to be accomplished. Adjusting the layout such that it maintains a state that can be changed, and then removing the boolean flag. This technical debt is a hold over from a previous major version of Swagger for compatibility.
