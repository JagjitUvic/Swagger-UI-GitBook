<h2>Section 2. Element Catalog</h2>

The following discusses the elements contained within the primary presentation, as well as a behaviour diagram representing a usage of the primary presentation.

<a id="section-2-a"></a>
<h3>Section 2.A Elements and their properties</h3>

Each element below is shown in the primary presentation.

<b>Client</b>

The Client represents a user of the Swagger-UI application. A client makes a request to load the endpoints UI of Swagger-UI (typically the home page of the Swagger-UI application) by entering the URL of the Swagger-UI application.

<b>API Server</b>

The API Server is the host of the OAS specification specific to the API it represents. This API Server usually also hosts the API that it represents. This API Server can be located on the same host as the one that hosts the Swagger-UI application, or an external host. This is discussed further in section 4.

<b>Validator</b>

The validator validates the the OAS specification obtained from the API Server for correct syntax. It can either be hosted at a location specified by the Swagger-UI administrator, the Swagger hosted location at: http://online.swagger.io/validator, or null if the administrator wishes the Swagger-UI system to not validation its specification.

<b>YAML Config Server</b>

The YAML Config Server hosts the swagger-config.yaml file externally if it is not present on the same host as Swagger-UI is installed. When requested, it provides this .yaml file to the System Configurer.

<b>System Initializer</b>

The System Initializer is the first step in the runtime execution to render the UI. It is responsible for initializing React by making a call to System component. It also handles the configuration of the Swagger-UI system.

<b>System</b>

The System component is responsible for managing React components, stores and states. This is a key file to focus on when trying to analyse the performance of the UI since all components and stores will follow the structure described here.

<b>React App</b>

The React App is the root React component and it renders the data present in the stores. This React component and it's children are responsible for updating (or not) once the changes on the store are passed down from System. Ideally we would like to avoid renders as much as possible and avoid cascading re-renders.

<b>Swagger-UI Endpoints View</b>

This component represents the main render of Swagger-UI. It is what the Client views on its web browser.

<b>System Configurer</b>

The Configurer component is a React plugin. System Initializer makes a request to this module for the swagger-config.yaml. This .yaml file contains information regarding the location of key components of Swagger-UI including:

 * dom_id: The dom_id to bind to.
 * domNode: The domNode to bind to in absence of a dom_id.
 * validatorUrl: The url of the OAS Specification validator.
 * url: The url of the OAS Specification of the API that Swagger-UI is to render.

This component processes this configuration file, then returns it to System Initializer.

<b>Specification Downloader</b>

The Specification Downloader component handles downloading the OAS Specification file from the API Server. It uses functionality provided by the Specification Resolver component to aid in this process. It downloads the OAS specification file from the url specified in the swagger-config.yaml. After the specification is downloaded it passed the file to the Specification Resolver for validation and resolving.

<b>Specification Resolver</b>

The Specification Resolver component is a React plugin. It handles the resolving and validation of the OAS specification. It uses the swagger-js dependency to resolve the obtained OAS specification. This resolved specification file is then passed back to be rendered.

<h3>Section 2.B Element Interfaces</h3>

According to SEI, an interface is a boundary across which two independent entities meet and interact or communicate with each other. The type of interface depends on the view type of its element.


#### SEI Element Interface Specification

### Interface Description 1

**Identity**

SwaggerUI Requests OAS Specs

**Resources**

  - <i>Syntax</i> <br>
  getOASSpecs(in configObj, out OASObj)<br>
  where <i>coinfigObj</i> is a JavaScript object with the following parameters:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th bgcolor="#EAFAF1">
        Parameters
      </th>
      <th bgcolor="#EAFAF1">
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>configUrl</td>
      <td>URL used to get external configuration document from</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>domNode</td>
      <td><b>REQUIRED</b>. The HTML DOM element where to put SwaggerUI </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dom_id</td>
      <td><b>REQUIRED</b> if domNode is not provided. The ID of a dom element where to put SwaggerUI</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>url</td>
      <td>The URL pointing to the API definition</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>validatorUrl</td>
      <td>Used to validate Swagger specs. https://online.swagger.io/validator by default. Setting it to null will disable validation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>spec</td>
      <td>A JS object that describes the OAS.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  - <i>Semantics</i><br>
	<i>Preconditions</i>: dom element for SwaggerUI, API URL, validator URL, valid JS object specification.<br>
  <i>Postconditions</i>: spec validation, spec resolution, UI rendering.<br>

  - <i>Errors</i><br>
	If neither of the required dom_id and domNode fields are present, SwaggerUI skips the rendering stage and outputs an error to the console.

**Data Types**

The configObj is a JS object that consists of multiple data types:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th bgcolor="#EAFAF1">
      Data Type
    </th>
    <th bgcolor="#EAFAF1">
      Parameter
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>configUrl, dom_id, url</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HTML Element</td>
    <td>domNode</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JS Object</td>
    <td>spec</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Array</td>
    <td>plugins</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>deepLinking, displayOperationId</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>defualtModelsExpandDepth, maxDisplayedTags</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Function</td>
    <td>tagsSorter</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Error Handling**

When making an API request for OAS specs, Swagger UI has predefined default values for all the parameters that the user does not provide, avoiding having attribute errors in the first place.

**Variability**

The interface cannot be changed.

**Quality Attributes**

<i>Performance</i>: the API request time affects the UI render speed.<br>
<i>Maintainability</i>: changes in the structure of dependent spec files might affect the validity of the API request object.

**Rationale**

Please refer to Section 5.

**Usage Guide**

[The official documentation describes the usage in detail.]( https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md)


### Interface Description 2

**Identity**

SwaggerUi Starts/Updates React Structure

**Resources**
  - <i>Syntax</i><br>
  startUpdateReactStructure(in Store, out ReactHTML)
  where <i>Store</i> is a JavaScript class with the following parameters:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th bgcolor="#EAFAF1">
        Parameters
      </th>
      <th bgcolor="#EAFAF1">

    <tr>
      <td>fn</td>
      <td>Used for adding helper functions for the system to be used elsewhere</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>rootInjects</td>
      <td>Injects values at the top level of the system</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>actions</td>
      <td>Allow creation of new Redux action creators within a piece of state in Swagger UI System</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Take action and state and return a new state</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>selectors</td>
      <td>Reach into their namespace's state to retrieve or derive data from the state</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>wrap-actions</td>
      <td>Used to override the original behaviour of actions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>components</td>
      <td>Classes or functions (stateless components) used for integration into the system</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  - <i>Semantics</i><br>
	<i>Preconditions</i>: valid return object from the previous interface call, valid Store class for React API, resolved plugin specs.
  <i>Postconditions</i>: layout rendering, React generated HTML page, output for User.

**Data Types**

The <i>Store</i> is a JS class that consists of multiple data types:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th bgcolor="#EAFAF1">
      Data Type
    </th>
    <th bgcolor="#EAFAF1">
      Parameter
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JS Class</td>
    <td>Store</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JS Object</td>
    <td>state, system, configs, components</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Array</td>
    <td>plugins</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Function</td>
    <td>fn</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Error handling**

The <i>Store</i> class that gets sent to the React API to start/update a structure has several error handling methods. One of them pertains to the <i>getWrappedAndBoundActions</i> method inside it. If the passed function is not the wrapped action, then a TypeError will be thrown. In addition, the <i>getBoundActions</i> method handles an error if it can’t serialize the arguments during the action assignment stage.

**Variability**

The interface cannot be changed.

**Quality attributes**

<i>Performance</i>: the API request time affects the React HTML render speed.
<i>Maintainability</i>: changes in the structure of dependent spec files might affect the validity of the API request object.

**Rationale**

Please refer to Section 5.

**Usage Guide**

The usage of this interface is connected to the outcome of the previous interface interaction, it should not be interacted with directly.

<h3>Section 2.C Element Behaviour</h3>

Behaviour diagrams are used to visualize and document the dynamic aspects of the system under consideration. We have captured following aspects of Swagger-UI:-

 * Order of Interactions

 * Activity and Stimulus

 * Behaviour relationship of structural elements.

We have selected state based static state charts for Swagger-UI because:-

 * As per SEI behaviour documentation this type of documentation should be chosen when a complete behaviour description is required.

 * We have multiple cases(arrival of any different stimulus), with this type of documentation, it is possible to infer the behaviour of the elements in any possible case.

 * Since we performed simulation as our analysis technique, this best suits our performance use-case.

We have represented the composite state of the system with three regions i.e the superstate Swagger-UI is divided into three substates.:-

**Web Browser**

It the beginning, during one cycle run of the system this component shows transition within three states:-

 * Idle - This is the initial state of web browser before the stimulus(user action).

 * Processing - After user request, the trigger is sent to react rendering system (components/index.js) and it attains processing state waiting for the response.

 * Rendered/Error - The finals stage results after the response returned via REACT rendering system, depending on the request parameters it can be a .html page or a render error(if no DOM id in configurations).

**React**

The major chunk of processing and rendering or Swagger-UI happens with this component of the system, the system may take different states based on configurations received from the YMAL server. This system is divided into multiple states:-

 * Idle - Initially the REACT system is waiting for request trigger.

 * Downloading YAML Configurations - The rendering process starts with two-way interaction with YAML server/ or locally stored YAML. The system receives configurations that specify parameters for .HTML rendering. In the meanwhile, the system is in waiting state for download/fetch to finish.

 * Error - If the configurations are missing DOM id or DOM node, the system goes in the error state and returns the error response.

 * Waiting for React Components - The system sends the request for react components to load.

 * Waiting for OAS Specifications - The REACT system sends the request to the OAS system for downloading and validation API specifications, and accordingly load the Swagger-UI.

 * Generating HTML - Fetching specifications and combining with REACT components generates the final .HTML that is returned to the Web Browser system.

**OAS System**

Before constructing and calling react components of the system (components/system.js) requests OAS server for specifications and validations. The process takes three states and returns validated specifications to react system for .html rendering.

 * Idle - When OAS system is idle and waiting for the request from REACT system for specifications.

 * Downloading - Once the system receives the request for API specifications, it connects to API server and starts downloading them.

 * Validating - After downloading the server goes into validation state where the request is sent to OAS validation server.

<h2>Section 3. Context Diagram</h2>

Shown below is a runtime context diagram for Swagger-UI. It shows various components, external tools, and frameworks that interact with Swagger-UI during runtime rendering. Interaction of some of the components like YAMl server depends on the configuration and specification values, this has been documented in the variability guide. The labeled boxes represent the entities(actor), the one in the center is the system(Swagger-UI), and around it multiple boxes for the external actor.

**Swagger Core**

Swagger-UI converts files with swagger API specifications into RESTful service documentation. Specification files are in *.json or *.yaml format, these files are converted from *.java (Resource classes with swagger annotations) with the help of swagger core generator.

**OAuth2**

Authorization to access RESTful service documentation on the Swagger-UI frontend is controlled by OAuth2. It enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to a web service.

**Swagger Editor**

A dedicated editor to design, describe and document swagger-based API's.

**Module Bundler (webpack)**

Bundling of assets like javascript files and images for rendering in a web browser. Webpack works on modules and their dependencies to generate static assets representing those modules.

**Smooth Webpage Scrolling(zenscroll)**

Zenscroll is a vanilla JavaScript library that enables animated vertical scrolling to an element or position within your document or within a scrollable element. It can also automatically smooth all scrolling within the same page.

**Deep Linking**

Swagger-UI allows you to deeply link to tags and operations within a spec. When Swagger-UI is provided a URL fragment at runtime, it will automatically expand and scroll to a specified tag or operation.

**OAS Validator**

The OAS (Open API Specifications) requested by React App are validated against a set of rules by specification resolver which further sends them back to main system component for react rendering.

**YAML Configurations**

Before actually rendering react components, Swagger-UI stores YAML configuration locally or in a YAML Server, these specifications provide DOM information for rendering react components.

**Web Browser**

Swagger-UI generates responsive and interactive .html files with RESTful service documentation. These files are then rendered using web browsers.

<h2>Section 4. Variability Guide</h2>

<b>Add or Remove Validator</b>

The Validator is an optional external component of Swagger-UI. At runtime, Swagger-UI will determine if a validator is to be used based on its appearance or lack of appearance in its swagger-config.yaml configuration file. In the case of no validator URL specified, the Swagger validator will not be used and the OAS specification will not be parsed for correct OAS syntax. If a validator URL exists, then the OAS specification will be parsed for correct syntax and the user of Swagger-UI will be notified of a successful or non-successful parse.

<b>Add or Remove API Server</b>

An external API Server is an optional external component of Swagger-UI. It hosts the OAS specification specific to the API it represents. At runtime, Swagger-UI will determine if an external API Server is to be used based on its appearance or lack of appearance in its swagger-config.yaml configuration file. If an external API Server is specified, it will retrieve the OAS Specification from there. Otherwise if hosting locally, the spec field in the swagger-config.yaml file must be provided with the Full OAS Specification.

<b>Add or Remove YAML Config Server</b>

The YAML Config Server is an optional external component of Swagger-UI. It hosts the swagger-config.yaml file. When requested, it provides this .yaml file to the System Configurer component. The Swagger-UI administrator can host this file on the same host as the Swagger-UI filled with the necessary fields. If the administrator of the Swagger-UI instance wishes to host this configuration file externally, they must still provide a swagger-config.yaml file in the same location that Swagger-UI is installed. However, it only contains a single field with the URL of the location of the external swagger-config.yaml file.

<a id="section-5"></a>
<h2>Section 5. Rationale</h2>

The purpose of this component and connector view is to provide a view to aid in the analysis of the selected quality attribute scenario. The quality attribute that this view helps to analyze is performance. One of the quality attribute scenarios from M2 relates to how quickly the endpoints UI is loaded. A successful response measure of the QAS would show that the endpoints UI is loaded in under 2 seconds on average. A Client-Server view was selected to aid in analyzing this scenario as it allows for the mapping of components and how they connect to external entities, which is the key use case for Swagger-UI. It shows an abstracted run time model of how a client makes a request to load the Swagger-UI, and how Swagger-UI then renders the UI to the client's web browser. This rationale assumes for simplicity and clarity that all external components exist, and none are located on the same machine as the Swagger-UI system. This incurs the highest potential response time for the loading of the endpoints UI as three external requests must be made.

As shown in the diagram, Swagger-UI begins its runtime execution and startup process through the System Initializer. The System Initializer ensures that all set up steps have occurred before rendering of the endpoints UI begins. This includes configuring all system components such as Swagger-UI's React store, and external URL configurations. This is necessary for React to run correctly. It must then obtain the swagger-config.yaml configuration file. Once this is obtained, it will have the location of the API Server and Validator. Once the setup steps are complete it requests the UI to be rendered through the System. This degree of separation exists so that ReactJS can kick in and begin its rendering steps.

It then must obtain the OAS Specification file from the API server through the Specification Downloader component. Then Specification Resolver component makes a request to the external Validator. It must validate that the OAS Specification file is valid OAS syntax. Only then may it resolve the OAS Specification file. This resolving process tells the UI component render what API routes and resources exist on the API based on the OAS Specification. This resolving process uses an external dependency called swagger-js. This resolver is what transforms the OAS specification into React readable rendering components.

This presentation does not show how each individual component is rendered to produce the final view that the client sees because it would create an overly complex diagram that does not effectively represent the loading of the UI, instead it is generalized. Each endpoint component has a unique React layout component (created inside the App React component). Once the OAS Specification has been resolved, it passes the result back to the System. From this point forward, it goes through the following React rendering loop:

1. Update the React rendering layout structure by passing the current component to the React App
2. Render the updated layout through the specific React layouts
3. Collect and render the components of the layout
4. Pass the created HTML to the System
5. Repeat until complete layout is rendered to HTML, and all endpoints are rendered.

This convenience is offered by the functionality provided by ReactJS. Swagger-UI has implemented a correct ReactJS component structure such that once the OAS Specification is provided, ReactJS takes over and renders the HTML. This process is fast and is what allows for quick rendering of the endpoints. Once the layout is fully rendered, the completed HTML page is passed to the Swagger-UI Endpoints View. This is what is rendered to the client's web browser.
